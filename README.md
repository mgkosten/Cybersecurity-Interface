## Explaining the program

This program allows a user to login to access different menu files. Each user has its own access rights. This makes it so that only certain users have access to certain files. For example one person could access all of the menu options while someone else could only access two of them. 

Logistics of program. If user is able to successfully login, meaning they entered the correct username and password, they are shown with a menu. They then have the choice to choose one of the menu options by entering the number they want to access. If they have the access rights to the menu option, the screen will display that they have accessed that application. However, if they did not have access, it says that they are not authorized to access that document and gives them the option to exit or return back to the main menu. Exiting ends the program, and going back to the menu gives them another chance to select a menu item.
